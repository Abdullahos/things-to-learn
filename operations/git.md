git stash temporarily shelves (or stashes) changes you've made to your working copy so you can work on something else, and then come back and re-apply them later on. Stashing is handy if you need to quickly switch context and work on something else, but you're mid-way through a code change and aren't quite ready to commit.
```
$ git status
On branch main
Changes to be committed:

    new file:   style.css

Changes not staged for commit:

    modified:   index.html

$ git stash
Saved working directory and index state WIP on main: 5002d47 our new homepage
HEAD is now at 5002d47 our new homepage

$ git status
On branch main
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

### At this point you're free to make changes, create new commits, switch branches, and perform any other Git operations; then come back and re-apply your stash when you're ready.

**Note that the stash is local to your Git repository; stashes are not transferred to the server when you push.**

## Re-applying your stashed changes

You can reapply previously stashed changes with git stash pop:
```
$ git status
On branch main
nothing to commit, working tree clean
$ git stash pop
On branch main
Changes to be committed:

    new file:   style.css

Changes not staged for commit:

    modified:   index.html
