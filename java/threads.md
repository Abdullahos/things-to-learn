## What is a Thread in Java?

A thread in Java is the path followed when executing a program. All Java programs have at least one thread, known as the main thread, which is created by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) at the programâ€™s start, when the main() method is invoked.

The Java Virtual Machine allows an application to have multiple threads of execution running concurrently

A Java process consists of multiple threads and a Java thread is often regarded as a light-weight process.

ex:
```
Thready extends Thread {
	public void run() {
		for (int i = 0; i < 10 ; i++) {
			System.out.println(i);
		}	

	}
}
public void main (String[] args) {
	Thready threadA = new Thready();
	Thready threadB = new Thready();
	threadA.start();	// invokes run concurrently
	threadB.start();	// invokes run  concurrently
} 
```

```
output:
	0
	0
	1
	1
	2
	2
	...
```
